This main purpose of this project was to showcase the fun side of BBC:Microbits and how it can be practically incorporated into our daily lives through a little coding in Micropython.

The items in this repository are the collective efforts from the group members Siyin, Pearlyn, Zilong, myself and our guiding mentor Mr Gi.
